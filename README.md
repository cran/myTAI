### Performing Phylotranscriptomics with R

The `myTAI` package allows users to capture evolutionary signals in developmental transcriptomes using a phylotranscriptomic approach.
    
Phylotranscriptomics defines the concept of combining genetic sequence information with 
gene expression levels to capture evolutionary signals during development (Domazet-Loso and Tautz, 2010; Quint et al., 2012; Drost et al., 2015).

This subfield of Evolutionary Developmental Biology aims to investigate stages or periods
of evolutionary conservation or constraint in developmental processes of extant species.

`myTAI` provides easy to use and optimized functions to perform phylostrancriptomic analyses for any annotated organism and developmental process of interest. Additionally, a customized visualization framework implemented in myTAI allows users to generate publication quality plots of their custom phylotranscriptomic analyses.


## Tutorials

Three tutorials will get you started with this package:

- [A Brief Introduction to the myTAI Package](https://github.com/HajkD/myTAI/blob/master/vignettes/Introduction.Rmd)
- [Intermediate Concepts of Phylotranscriptomics](https://github.com/HajkD/myTAI/blob/master/vignettes/Intermediate.Rmd)
- [Advanced Topics of Phylotranscriptomics](https://github.com/HajkD/myTAI/blob/master/vignettes/Advanced.Rmd)


You can also read the tutorials within ([RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/)) :

```r

# first install the myTAI package 
# -> see "Fast Installation Guide" for the current development version
install.packages("myTAI", build_vignettes = TRUE, dependencies = TRUE)

# source the myTAI package
library(myTAI)

# look for all tutorials (vignettes) available in the myTAI package
# this will open your web browser
browseVignettes("myTAI")

# or as single tutorials

# open tutorial: Introduction
 vignette("Introduction", package = "myTAI")

# open tutorial: Intermediate
 vignette("Intermediate", package = "myTAI")

# open tutorial: Advanced
 vignette("Advanced", package = "myTAI")


```

In the `myTAI` framework you can find:

#### Phylotranscriptiomics Measures:

* `TAI()` : Function to compute the Transcriptome Age Index (TAI)
* `TDI()` : Function to compute the Transcriptome Divergence Index (TDI)
* `REMatrix()` : Function to compute the relative expression profiles of all phylostrata or divergence-strata
* `RE()` : Function to transform mean expression levels to relative expression levels

#### Visualization and Analytics Tools:

* `PlotPattern()` : Function to plot the TAI or TDI profiles and perform statistical tests
* `PlotCorrelation()` : Function to plot the correlation between phylostratum values and divergence-stratum values
* `PlotRE()` : Function to plot the relative expression profiles
* `PlotBarRE()` : Function to plot the mean relative expression levels of phylostratum or divergence-stratum classes as barplot
* `PlotMeans()` : Function to plot the mean expression profiles of phylostrata or divergence-strata
* `PlotDistribution()` : Function to plot the frequency distribution of genes within the corresponding phylostratigraphic map or divergence map


#### A Statistical Framework and Test Statistics:

* `FlatLineTest()` : Function to perform the __Flat Line Test__ that quantifies the statistical significance of an observed
phylotranscriptomics pattern (significant deviation from a frat line = evolutionary signal)
* `ReductiveHourglassTest()` : Function to perform the __Reductive Hourglass Test__ that statistically evaluates the existence of a phylotranscriptomic hourglass pattern (hourglass model)
* `EarlyConservationTest()` : Function to perform the __Reductive Early Conservation Test__ that statistically evaluates the existence of a monotonically increasing phylotranscriptomic pattern (early conservation model)

All three functions also include visual analytics tools to quantify the goodness of test statistics.

#### Minor Functions for Better Usibility and Additional Analyses

`age.apply()`, `bootMatrix()`, `CollapseReplicates()`,`CombinatorialSignificance()`, `ecScore()`, `FilterRNASeqCT()`, `MatchMap()`, `omitMatrix()`, `pMatrix()`, `pStrata()`, `rhScore()`, and `tf()`


## Install Developer Version of myTAI

```r
# The developer version can be installed directly from github:

# install.packages("devtools")

# install developer version of myTAI
library(devtools)
install_github("HajkD/myTAI", build_vignettes = TRUE, dependencies = TRUE)

# On Windows, this won't work - see ?build_github_devtools
# install_github("HajkD/myTAI", build_vignettes = TRUE, dependencies = TRUE)

# When working with Windows, first you need to install the
# R package: rtools -> http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/
# or consult: http://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/

# Afterwards you can install devtools -> install.packages("devtools")
# and then you can run:

devtools::install_github("HajkD/myTAI", build_vignettes = TRUE, dependencies = TRUE)

# and then call it from the library
library("myTAI", lib.loc = "C:/Program Files/R/R-3.1.1/library")

```
