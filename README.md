### Performing Phylotranscriptomics with R

The `myTAI` package allows users to capture evolutionary signals in developmental transcriptomes using a phylotranscriptomic approach.
    
Phylotranscriptomics defines the concept of combining genetic sequence information with 
gene expression levels to capture evolutionary signals during development (Domazet-Loso and Tautz, 2010; Quint et al., 2012; Drost et al., 2015).

This subfield of Evolutionary Developmental Biology aims to investigate stages or periods
of evolutionary conservation or constraint in developmental processes of extant species.

`myTAI` provides easy to use and optimized functions to perform phylostrancriptomic analyses for any annotated organism and developmental process of interest. Additionally, a customized visualization framework implemented in myTAI allows users to generate publication quality plots of their custom phylotranscriptomic analyses.

# to perform differential gene expression analyses with myTAI
# please install the edgeR package
# install edgeR
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")

In the `myTAI` framework you can find:

#### Phylotranscriptiomics Measures:

* `TAI()` : Function to compute the Transcriptome Age Index (TAI)
* `TDI()` : Function to compute the Transcriptome Divergence Index (TDI)
* `REMatrix()` : Function to compute the relative expression profiles of all phylostrata or divergence-strata
* `RE()` : Function to transform mean expression levels to relative expression levels
* `pTAI()` : Compute the Phylostratum Contribution to the global TAI
* `pTDI()` : Compute the Divergence Stratum Contribution to the global TDI
* `pMatrix()` : Compute Partial TAI or TDI Values
* `pStrata()` : Compute Partial Strata Values

#### Visualization and Analytics Tools:

* `PlotPattern()` : Function to plot the TAI or TDI profiles and perform statistical tests

## Install Developer Version of myTAI

```r
# The developer version can be installed directly from github:

# install.packages("devtools")

# install developer version of myTAI
library(devtools)
install_github("HajkD/myTAI", build_vignettes = TRUE, dependencies = TRUE)

# On Windows, this won't work - see ?build_github_devtools
# install_github("HajkD/myTAI", build_vignettes = TRUE, dependencies = TRUE)

# When working with Windows, first you need to install the
# R package: rtools -> http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/
# or consult: http://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/

# Afterwards you can install devtools -> install.packages("devtools")
# and then you can run:

devtools::install_github("HajkD/myTAI", build_vignettes = TRUE, dependencies = TRUE)

# and then call it from the library
library("myTAI", lib.loc = "C:/Program Files/R/R-3.1.1/library")

```
